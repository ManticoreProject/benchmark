# TODO: add these FFI tests:   ffi-fib, ffi-trigfib
# you'll need versions with -Ccshim=true and without it (NOT false).
# I think the only case where cshim is actually off by default is
# contig stack and cps.

# TODO: add these CML tests:  cml-pingpong, cml-spawn
# you'll want to pass -p 1 to level the playing-field with SML/NJ.
# you'll also need to pass -stacksz 128m to all stack strategies,
# because jemalloc doesn't like many small-allocation requests! This should
# keep things fair among all stack types until a custom allocator is developed.
# in fact since that flag is ignored by cps and linkstack, it can be passed to all
# manticore versions.

# TODO: test performance of segstack with -lazyunderflow on all tests
