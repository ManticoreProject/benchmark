# TODO: test performance of segstack with -stacksz set at various sizes
# you'll want to pick the best one of the handful for the new default.
# 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k, 64k, not much morethan 256.

# TODO: add these FFI tests:   ffi-fib, ffi-trigfib
# you'll need versions with -Ccshim=true and without it (NOT false).
# I think the only case where cshim is actually off by default is
# contig stack and cps.

# TODO: add these CML tests:  cml-pingpong, cml-spawn
# you'll need to pass -p 1 to the binaries since there's an issue with VProcExit.

# TODO: test performance of segstack with -lazyunderflow on all tests

# TODO: test performance of segstack and resize stack with -sealingcapture
# in EC and CML tests.

#    good roadmap to help them digest the paper, but also important to highlight
