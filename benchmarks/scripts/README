** Benchmark interface **

Each benchmark shall implement the following signature.

signature MAIN : sig
  val run : int -> unit
end

The run function takes a problem size, runs the benchmark,
and prints the result to stdout. The result should be a
legal SML expression.

** Benchmark script **

The benchmark script takes the following parameters:

    -s	      problem size**
    -p	      number of processors*
    -f	      path to the executable
    -e	      indicates that the binary was compiled for sequential execution
    -n	      name of the experiment
    -d        brief description of the experiment
    -t	      number of repeated runs to do for each data point (default is 1)**
    -r	      specify the manticore root directory (default is provided by configure script)
    -i	      string used to report the input parameter used for the benchmark

* zero or more instances of the argument may occur
** the argument is optional

** Benchmark results **
Results are formatted as SML modules that match the signature in 
  manticore-db/src/sml/experiment.sig
and generated in the results directory.
