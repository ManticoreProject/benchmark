Right now, this benchmark is being miscompiled by Manticore...
it's raising an exception somewhere when it should never raise
an exception (MLton and SML/NJ confirm this).

- fun shorterp (x, y) =
  (not (List.null y))
  andalso (((List.null x) orelse (shorterp (List.tl x, List.tl y))) handle _ => (Print.print "tl failed" ; true))

  this handler gets fired, so i think the issue is with compiling an expression like:

  x andalso (y orelse z)
