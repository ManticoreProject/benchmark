(* LOOP2 -- An "extremely perverse" way to write a loop. *)

(* not using a ref cell for this since it's not usual in ML.
     we also accumulate something for error check.

     ALSO: in clinger's work they save the cont to a ref cell and then
           return through the callcc, which is not allowed in with callec.
           I've tried to capture the essence of the benchmark (callcc then
           immediately throw it.) like so

  fun worker (n, acc) =
      if n = 0
        then acc
        else worker (Cont.callec(fn k =>
                        Cont.throw(k, (n-1, acc+1))
                        )
