- for all stack-based versions, this program no longer works (as of 9/25/2018)

- linkstack fails to compile because a missing "ASM_Callec1"

- contig and segmented are now segfaulting during a run inside an
  uncurried function, isWinFor_uncurried. This might be related to John's
  recent uncurrying fix in trunk (and cherry-picked to stacks). See
