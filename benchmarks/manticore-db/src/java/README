The utility in this directory consumes a JSON file and writes its
information into the Manticore database.

Note the two (third-party) jar files in this directory are necessary
to execute the code.

To compile the code, run the script

  ./compile.sh

. To run the code, run the script

  ./run.sh <json-file>

.

The scripts are just shell commands that run the javac and java with
the appropriate flags.

See TODO for outstanding issues.
