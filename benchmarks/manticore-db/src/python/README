Here be tools for plotting data from the Manticore benchmark database.

There are currently programs to plot 
  * (overlaid) speedup curves, and 
  * efficiencies

The interface is, at present, primitive. Use by editing values in the
python scripts and executing them from the prompt.

NOTE: it is presently assumed that the baseline time is the median of
a particular batch of runs where the given value for 'n_procs' is
0. This should be generalized.

*********

To make an efficiency plot:

* look through the table 'contexts' and find
  * context_id for baseline context
  * context_id for parallel context
* edit the variables under EDIT ME! in efficiency.py
* run 'python efficiency.py' from the shell

This will display a plot in an interactive display, from which the
image can be saved into various formats.

*********

To make a speedup plot, follow the same steps, but look up as many
context ids as you like. The speedup plot will automatically overlay
multiple speedup curves on the same axes. Please alter the appropriate
values in EDIT ME! in speedup.py, then run 'python speedup.py' from
the shell.
