This benchmark constructs a ring of 256 threads which then pass a token around for
some number of cycles (100000 is a good number).  Because message-passing is synchronous,
it does not exhibit any parallelism, but it is a good test of overhead.

The original benchmark was written for a number of concurrent languages by Carl Ritson;
