** Benchmark interface **

Each benchmark shall implement the following signature.

signature MAIN : sig
  val run : int -> unit
end

The run function takes a problem size, runs the benchmark, and prints the result to stdout. The result should be a legal SML expression.

** Benchmark makefile **

The makefile shall include rules for compiling each version of the benchmark. At a minimum, each parallel benchmark shall include rules for the standard parallel version, the sequential elison (parallel code compiled as a sequential program) and the sequential baseline.

** Benchmark script **

The benchmark script takes the following parameters:

    -s	      problem size*
    -p	      number of processors*
    -a	      makefile rule to build a parallel binary**
    -b	      makefile rule to build a sequential binary**
    -f	      path to the directory containing the benchmark
    -l	      max leaf size (used by the rope data structure)
    -n	      name of the experiment
    -x	      compiler flags
    -t	      number of repeated runs to do for each data point (default is 1)**

The * indicates that one or more values may be provided and the ** indicates that one or no value may be provided.

The script expects the makefile build rule to create a binary of the same name in the benchmark directory.
